# EDA Analysis on HAM10000 Skin Decease Dataset

The goal of this EDA is to convert the dataset in such a way so that it can be easily be feeded in the model and also the preprocessing can be done into an easy manner.
Here, the images are separated into seven (7) different folders renamed as the deceases. Previously they were into two folders and five .csv files have been provided in the overall dataset. The images were catagorized using the metadata file.
